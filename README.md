# BE-Industry Extensions
Welcome to the BEIndustryExtension repository!

This repo is a platform for BE-Industry and all connected partners to work together to extend the BE-Industry solution. 

# Extensibility requests

The following are the types of requests you can submit to unblock your app:

* Add new integration events – Get the event you need to hook-in to a process.
* Change function visibility – For example, make a public function external or a similar change so you can call it from your extension and reuse the business logic.
* Replace Option with Enum – Replace a specific option with an enum that supports your extension. The new type enum is extensible, but all code was written for non-extensible options.
* Extensibility enhancements – Request changes in the application code that will improve extensibility.

We’ll have a look at your request, and if we can we’ll implement it asap. If we can’t we’ll let you know and briefly explain why not. When that happens, don’t be discouraged. Go back to the drawing board, see if you can work it out, and then come back and submit another request.

# Disclaimer

This repo is leaned very closely to the official Microsoft ALAppExtension repository found here: https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions
